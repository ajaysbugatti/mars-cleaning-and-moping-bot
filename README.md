# mars-cleaning-and-moping-bot
cleaning and moping bot  is a smartphone controlled robot that cleans our house's floor! The rotating mops on the front of the robot along with a vaccume cleaner (used to clean the surface from dust) at the front can do the job perfectly. There's also a water pump system and water reservoir which can be switched on when required to throw water on the floor and make the mops moist for a proper clean
